These are the stage 1 and stage 2 bootloaders for GRUB legacy 0.96.
They are used to build the bootstrap floppy disk image that is used
later to build the floppy disk image of NativeOS.

They are provided here since chances are your Linux distribution
already uses GRUB 2, which uses a different schema where doing this
is harder.

Either way, you can download these files by yourself at the following
address: <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/grub-0.96-i386-pc.tar.gz> or
you can get these stage bootloader files by yourself on any other
way.
