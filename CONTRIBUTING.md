# Contributing to this project

Please, read the complete contents of this document in order to avoid
miscomunication or wasting your own free time. This document declares how
to contribute to this project.

## Roadmap

**This project has no public roadmap**. This means that I'm not disclosing
what I'm working on when I'm working on this project. This is intended at
this moment for this project because the project is not mature or stable
enough and is still under development.

This also means that the code can break, change or be rewritten at any
time without further notice; therefore, don't let your contributions stale,
keep them fresh.

## Issue reporting

Use the issue tracker to file bug reports on existing features or to propose
new features for the software.

* Bug reports should include enough information for making them reproducible.
  This is the best way for making sure that the issue can be fixed in first
  place. Provide as much context as you can: what was happening, what is your
  computer, your OS, your compiler... please note that bug reports without
  enough context could be sadly closed as invalid or not reproducible.

* Technical suggestions should include an explanation on why is it a good
  idea to have this added into the project. Please note that, because of
  time constraints and because of having my own roadmap, I still reserve the
  right for rejecting suggestions that I consider don't fit within my project
  goals.

## Pull requests

**Please, do not send pull requests at this moment.**

* Because this code is done as a research and not as a serious project, there
  is some self-challenging factor in there that makes accepting external code
  look like cheating. I'm doing this project because I want to learn. Having
  other people do the project for me defeats this purpose.

* As I said before, I have my own roadmap, and unexpected new features may
  disrupt my workflow. You might have used code that was soon to be deprecated
  or that already had been removed by the time you submitted your PR, for
  instance.

## Forking this project

This code is still open source. Therefore, you are free to fork this project
and modify it provided you do it on a way that doesn't conflicts with the
open source license used by this project. For instance, if you want to use
this research repository as a starting point for your own experiments.

Please note that most of the conventions for this repository don't apply for
forks. This means that you are free to accept pull requests in your own fork,
change the code of conduct and such.
