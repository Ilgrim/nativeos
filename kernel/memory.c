/**
 * @file
 * @brief memory primitive functions and other structures
 *
 * This module contains function implementations designed to work with memory in kernel.
 * They are not very clean. They should probably move into new modules such as a future
 * libk or mm. Current memory management in NativeOS is very poor. The system allocates
 * memory linearly but there is no cleanup system and the current implementation is
 * prone to fragmentation due to page aligning.

 * in order to know when free space is available in the machine to be used by
 * the kernel as kernel heap.

 * @brief Allocate a memory region in the kernel heap.
 *
 * Invoking this function should reserve a memory region to be used as a buffer in
 * some context. The requester must tell the function how much space would it want
 * and the system should guarantee that no further calls to kmalloc will return
 * memory buffers that overlap with a previously returned memory buffer unless one of
 * them has been freed.
 *
 * The caller can request the allocated buffer to be page aligned by using the align
 * parameter. If alignment is requested, the allocated memory area will start on a new
 * empty 4 kB page, so it's guaranteed that ptr & 0xFFF == 0 for the pointer ptr. This
 * is needed for virtual memory.
 *
 * Sometimes it may be required to know the exact memory location where the buffer has
 * been allocated. If a pointer to an integer variable is provided on the phys output
 * parameter, it will be dereferenced and overwritten by the physical memory address
 * of the allocated buffer on the computer memory. To avoid this behavior simply pass
 * NULL.
 *
 * @param size how many bytes do we want to reserve.
 * @param align if true, the buffer will be aligned into the boundaries of a 4 kB page.
 * @param phys points to an integer variable where to store the memory address, or NULL.
 *
 * @return pointer to a valid buffer that has been allocated.
