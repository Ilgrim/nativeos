 * @brief memory primitive functions and other structures

 * They are not very clean. They should probably move into new modules such as a future
 * libk or mm. Current memory management in NativeOS is very poor. The system allocates
 * memory linearly but there is no cleanup system and the current implementation is
 * prone to fragmentation due to page aligning.
