 * @brief Main routine for the NativeOS Kernel.
 *
 * This function can be considered the main entrypoint after the bootstrap
 * function in boot.s extracts the multiboot data from the processor registers
 * and places them onto the stack in order to provide them as arguments.
 * This kernel will assume that it has been loaded by a multiboot compatible
 * bootloader such as GRUB. There is some checking to assert that but little
 * effort is made.
 *
 * According to section 3.2 of the Multiboot 0.6.96 specification, available
 * at https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/multiboot.html,
 * the magic number value must equal 0x2BADB002. The structure will contain
 * values that are set by the bootloader as described on section 3.3 of the
 * specification.
 *
 * @param magic_number the magic number provided by the bootloader.
 * @param multiboot_ptr a pointer to a multiboot structure.
