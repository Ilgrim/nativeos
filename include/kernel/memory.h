/**
 * @file
 * @brief memory primitive functions and other structures
 *
 * This module contains function implementations designed to work with memory in kernel.
 * They are not very clean. They should probably move into new modules such as a future
 * libk or mm. Current memory management in NativeOS is very poor. The system allocates
 * memory linearly but there is no cleanup system and the current implementation is
 * prone to fragmentation due to page aligning.

 * @brief Allocate a memory buffer in memory
 *
 * Calling this function will return a pointer to a memory buffer that can be used for
 * any purpose. The function will allocate the requested size. Because there is no
 * memory protection system at this level, it is not guaranteed the results of accessing
 * locations outside the boundaries of the requested buffer.
 *
 * @param size how many bytes to allocate.
 * @return the pointer to the memory buffer.
