NativeOS

	This is the main repository for the NativeOS project.
	NativeOS is a hobbyist operating system for the x86 platform.

Compiling NativeOS

	NativeOS can be compiled on Linux i686 and Linux x86_64.
	It should work by just running  make  provided you have all
	the tools installed. See Documents/Building.txt for more
	information.

	This project makes use of the following tools: gcc, nasm, ld.
	You'll need to install these tools first. Also, you'll probably
	want a virtual machine to test this kernel. There are instructions
	for building the kernel as a QEMU raw drive.
