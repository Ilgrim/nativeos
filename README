NativeOS

    This is the main repository for the NativeOS project.
	NativeOS is a hobbyist operating system for the x86 platform.

Compiling NativeOS

	Please note that the building process has only been tested
	on an i386 Linux virtual machine at the moment. Testing on
	x64 Linux and on OS X is on the checklist. There is no support
	for Windows.

	This project makes use of the following tools: gcc, nasm, ld,
	make, genisoimage, qemu... You'll need to install these tools.
	genisoimage can be installed on Ubuntu based system using APT.
	On Arch Linux it is included in the cdrkit package.

	To generate an ISO image with the NativeOS operating system
	run the command  `make iso`. If you want to quickly execute this
	image on QEMU, provided you have it installed you can run
	`make qemu`.

	The following directory structure is used in the NativeOS
	repository. Please note that all the root folders begin
