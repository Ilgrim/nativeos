	This is the main routine for the NativeOS Kernel. It will start the
	system and jump to user mode so that the init process can run.
	At the moment no information is gathered from multiboot but I expect
	this to change in the near future.
	
	Multiboot will provide two arguments here: one is the magic number,
	which must be 0x2BADB002, and the other one is the data structure with
	information that might be required for some things.
